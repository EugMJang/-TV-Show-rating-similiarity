We will take turn taking notes for the meeting starting with emjang2, evanmp2, then davidy4.
The notes will be stored on a google doc, including the date when the meeting occured.
During these meetings, we will report on our progress and assign tasks for each person to work on before the next meeting.
We will also take turns writing the weekly development log starting with evanmp2, david4, then emjang2
This entry will be reviewed by the team in the next meeting.

## Assistance
We will utilize Discord to ask for any assistance/any general communication. Members will try to respond within 24 hours of help request.

## Respect
The person who is taking notes will also serve as the meeting leader, who will accordingly ensure that everyone has a chance to voice their opinion and respect other's opinions. 
Decisions will be made based on majority vote.

# Collaboration

## Work Distribution
During the team meetings, tasks will be brainstormed and delegated to each person accordingly by the whole group. 
Unexpected complications or work will be delegated to each person and agreed on via Discord.
Equality of work will be measured by all group members

## Time Commitment
Each member will be expected to work no less than two hours and no more than 6 hours on the project per week. 
If someone expects more than 6 hours of work, or is really busy that week, members who are least busy that week will assist the one member to finish the task within a reasonable time frame.
If someone is habitually not finishing their tasks, they may be asked about the circumstances, and based on the circumstances, further actions may be taken, such as calling in a staff member.

## Conflict Resolution
In cases of a conflict, we will settle in Smash, with tournament rules. The winner will decide with the help of a third party.
